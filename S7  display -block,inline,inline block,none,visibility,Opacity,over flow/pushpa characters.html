      Pushpa: The Rise is a 2021 Indian Telugu-language action drama film
      written and directed by Sukumar, and produced by Mythri Movie Makers and
      Muttamsetty Media. The film stars Allu Arjun as Pushpa Raj, a coolie who
      rises in a syndicate that smuggles red sandalwood, a rare wood that grows
      only in the Seshachalam Hills of Andhra Pradesh. The ensemble supporting
      cast includes Fahadh Faasil (in his Telugu debut), Rashmika Mandanna,
      Dhananjaya, Jagadeesh Prathap Bandari, Ajay, Raj Tirandasu, Sunil, Rao
      Ramesh, Ajay Ghosh, Shatru, Shanmukh and Anasuya Bharadwaj. The film began
      production in December 2019 but was halted in March 2020 by the COVID-19
      pandemic. Filming resumed in November 2020 and ended in November 2021,
      predominantly taking place at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad and
      Maredumilli forest in Andhra Pradesh. Devi Sri Prasad composed the film's
      score and soundtrack while the cinematography and editing are performed by
      Miroslaw Kuba Brozek and Karthika Srinivas–Ruben respectively. Pushpa: The
      Rise was released on 17 December 2021. The film received generally mixed
      reviews from critics, who praised the performances, action choreography,
      cinematography, direction, dialogues, and soundtrack but criticised the
      runtime, screenplay and editing. The film was commercially successful,
      grossing over ₹360–373 crore at the worldwide box office. It became the
      highest-grossing Indian film of 2021, and ranks among the highest-grossing
      Telugu films of all time. In 2024 it was featured retrospectively at the
      74th Berlinale. At the 69th National Film Awards, Pushpa: The Rise won two
      awards – Best Actor (Arjun) and Best Music Direction (Prasad). At the 67th
      Filmfare Awards South, it won seven awards meant for Telugu films,
      including Best Film, Best Director (Sukumar) and Best Actor (Arjun). It is
      the first installment in the Pushpa film series, and a sequel titled
      Pushpa 2: The Rule is scheduled for release on 6 December 2024. Plot In
      the late 1990s, labourer Pushpa Raj decides to smuggle red sandalwood with
      his friend Kesava. He moves up the ranks in smuggler Konda Reddy's group
      while evading DSP Govindappa. Konda's brother Jaali hates Pushpa for
      getting more attention from his elder brother. Konda's boss, Srinu,
      entrusts Konda to keep his contraband of tonnes of sandalwood safe from
      the Police Department, and Pushpa is assigned to the task by the Reddy
      brothers, so that if anything happens to it, they can blame him in front
      of Srinu. Jaali intentionally sabotages Pushpa so he'll get caught by the
      police, but Pushpa and Kesava use their quick thinking to avoid getting
      caught. Pushpa finds out Srinu is scamming his workers and tells Konda,
      but he refuses to go up against the powerful Srinu. Pushpa falls in love
      with Srivalli, a milk seller, and an engagement is arranged. During the
      ceremony, Pushpa's elder half-brother Mohan makes a scene, revealing
      Pushpa is illegitimate. In the ensuing scuffle, Pushpa's mother gets hurt,
      which motivates him to make his way up. He bypasses Srinu, and is able to
      get a higher profit for the wood that he agrees to split with Konda. Jaali
      discovers Srivalli's father is a mole for Govindappa; lusting after
      Srivalli, Jaali blackmails her to sleep with him to save her father.
      Srivalli tells Pushpa, who beats Jaali and leaves him paralysed. Jaali
      doesn't tell Konda who beat him, wanting to kill Pushpa himself, but Konda
      discovers the truth on his own. Konda attempts to kill Pushpa, but they're
      attacked by Srinu's men and brother-in-law, Mogileesu, who kills Konda
      Reddy. Pushpa rescues Konda's younger brother Jakka, rekindling their
      partnership, and murders Mogileesu. MLA Naidu arranges a truce between
      Pushpa and Srinu, but after discovering about the latter's scams, he
      appoints Pushpa to replace Srinu. As time goes by, Pushpa takes control of
      the entire syndicate.
